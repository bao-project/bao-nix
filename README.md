## -1. Install dependencies

Install Nix

```
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh -s -- --daemon
```

## 1. Setup base environment

Clone this repo and cd to it:

```
git clone https://github.com/bao-project/bao-nix.git
cd bao-nix
```
---
## 2. Build environment
Just execute:

**Note:** For now, only qemu-aarch64-virt is supported [Appendix I](#Appendix-I).
```
nix-build
```

And all the needed source and images will be automatically downloaded and built. 

---

## 3. Deploy the environment

If you are targetting an emulator platform like QEMU, after building 
you can start it with:

```
./run_qemu.sh
```

In this case, if you don't have qemu for the target architecture installed, 
it will build it for you.
